## The Colored Dots Rule-Learning Task
This repository contains the source code for an online experiment coded with jsPsych. 
It was created for a thesis project in cognitive science, on the topic of individual differences in metacognitive monitoring accuracy during concept learning.

### The Experimental Task
The experiment was adapted from the article _Active Inference, Curiosity, and Insight_ by Friston et al. (2017). Participants are shown a sequence of stimuli consisting of a cross pattern of colored dots. For each stimulus, the participant responds with a color. Their task is to identify the secret rule that dictates which of the presented colors is the correct one to report.

The figure below is a schematic overview of the experimental procedure, which has two conditions.
