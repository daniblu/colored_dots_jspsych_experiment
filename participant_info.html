  <p>Thank you for your interest in participating in this study.</p>

  <h2>Purpose of the Study</h2>
  <p>This study investigates how individuals experience confidence during a learning process. Specifically, the study examines how accurately people assess their own understanding while learning. Some individuals may feel more confident than their performance suggests, while others may underestimate their understanding. Insights from this research may help improve future teaching methods. The study forms part of the researcher’s Master’s thesis.</p>

  <h2>Experiment Overview</h2>
  <p>You will complete a short behavioral task in which you will view sets of colored dots and respond based on your understanding. You will also be asked to answer a few demographic questions and provide responses related to psychological topics. The entire session is expected to last maximum 25 minutes.</p>

  <h2>Risks</h2>
  <p>This study involves no known risks beyond those encountered in daily life.</p>

  <h2>Data Handling and Privacy</h2>
  <p>The experiment is hosted using GitHub Pages, and data is securely transferred to a Google Sheet via Google Apps Script. Data are stored temporarily on Google’s cloud infrastructure before being downloaded and stored securely on a private, password-protected laptop for analysis. No personally identifiable information (PII) is collected; responses are anonymous throughout the process. Because your data cannot be linked back to you, it will not be possible to withdraw your data once the experiment has been completed. Data may be stored for a minimum of 10 years.</p>

  <h2>Voluntary Participation</h2>
  <p>Your participation is entirely voluntary. You may discontinue your participation in the study at any time without giving a reason. There are no consequences to discontinuing your participation.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions about the study, please contact the researcher at the email address listed above.</p>
